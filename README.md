### 📜Requirements

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Java](https://www.java.com). 
Also it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [Spring Tools 4](https://spring.io/tools)

### 🎲 Running the Back End (server) 

```bash
# Clone este repositório
$ git clone <https://github.com/Alisson-Henrique/my-anime-list.git>

# Access the project folder in spring tools 4 

# Change the MySQL database user and password in the file
$ my-anime-list/my-anime-list/src/main/resources/application.properties

# Run the application as spring boot app 

# The server will start on port:8080 - access <http://localhost:8080>
```
